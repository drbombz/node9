There also is a button to re-request the image masquerading as Internet Explorer 11 (you might need to click it a second time because Firefox likes to serve the cached image), and a button to send animated WebP images to ezgif.com for conversion to animated GIFs.\n\nNew in version 1.5.1 (forthcoming): When the script can't inject buttons into a page, a new popup window will appear with possible workarounds.\n\nNew in version 1.4: New button to Copy the image to the Clipboard in PNG format. Permission needs to be enabled on the Add-ons page (click the gear/wheel button on the add-on button bar, then click Permissions, then click the slider switch for \"Input data to the clipboard).\n\nIf you want to discourage sites from sending webP format images at all, especially if you are having trouble saving GIFv files, check out my other extension: Don't \"Accept\" image/webp.\n\nConfiguring the context menu item\n\nThese are the default actions, but you can switch them around to fit your needs (on the Options panel):\n\n* Click \"Save webP as...\" to show format/quality buttons overlaid on the image\n* Shift+click \"Save webP as...\" to save in PNG format\n* Ctrl+click \"Save webP as...\" to save in JPEG format at 92% quality (on Mac, use Command+click)\n\nCustom save folders\n\nExtensions can only save under your Downloads folder, but you can set up date or site folders to help keep organized.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nThe button bar may not appear and images may not be saved if scripts are blocked from running in the page (for example, by the NoScript extension).\n\nGoogle Photos As of August 6, 2023, the add-on cannot construct a valid and useful file name to save from the slideshow style viewer on Google Photo. Please right-click > Open Image in New Tab if you need to convert an image from Google Photos until I can find a solution.\n\nNotes\n\nI regret having to use the \"All sites\" permission, but most images these days load from a different server, and that creates a cross-site access problem (canvas taint) that often blocks the extension from saving unless it has permission in advance. In a future release, I will try to offer a different approach that uses fewer privileges.","weeklyDownloads":1185,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"jscher2000","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13029303/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290120.png?modified=1714782873","width":655,"height":440,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290120.jpg?modified=1714782873","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":358,"caption":"Look for a new right-click context menu item for images.

While very powerfull, any changes will require a restart of the browser to take effect.\n\nThis extension adds a new button to your toolbar that allows you to toggle custom userchrome.css styling on-the fly. The magic happens by including special CSS selectors in your user styles. Manipulating those selectors allows you to enable/disable up to three of your modifications on-the-fly.\n\nThe addon accomplishes this by changing the browsers 'title prefix' attribute. Don't worry! By using invisible UTF-8 characters by default, you won't even notice a thing! Toggle a single style or select up to three styles to toggle in a drop-down menu. Hardcore keyboard users can even use customizable keyboard-shortcuts.\n\nPermissions and Privacy:\nThe \"Allow notifications\" permission is needed to display a browser notification when you toggle a style. You can disable these in the settings.\nAs for privacy, this extension doesn't connect to the internet whatsoever. You can check the source code on the 'Support site' linked on this page.","weeklyDownloads":101,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Joolee","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12574891/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264935.png?modified=1642871465","width":600,"height":190,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264935.jpg?modified=1642871465","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":169,"caption":"Toggle a single style with the toolbar button"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264936.png?modified=1642871465","width":601,"height":498,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264936.jpg?modified=1642871465","thumbnailWidth":483,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Switch between different styles"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/264/264937.png?modified=1642871465","width":601,"height":437,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/264/264937.jpg?modified=1642871465","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":388,"caption":"Select multiple styles to be active together"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/265/265778.png?modified=1642871470","width":1472,"height":684,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/265/265778.jpg?modified=1642871470","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":248,"caption":"Sample of the settings for a single toggle"}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/joolee3000?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":5,"reviewCount":2,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle/reviews/","updateDate":1645465273000}]}
